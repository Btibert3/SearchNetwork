This project looks to study the relationship of colleges as defined by lists found on a number of College Search sites.  More specifically, the list of schools commonly shown as "Similar Schools."


# Goals:
- Highlight the connectivity of schools and demonstrate how viewing competitor colleges as a `graph` may help understand how colleges are related
- Evalute if the relationships in the graph can explain the variance in common admissions metrics.
- Attempt to predict the probability of two colleges being listed as "similar."
